Neuron Diary is a simple but production-style AI project built as a **daily learning journey**.
The goal is to practice **real machine learning workflows**, not just theory.

This project trains a neural network on numeric data, tracks model versions, validates inputs,
logs predictions, and provides a clean CLI experience.

## 🚀 Features
- Neural Network using TensorFlow
- Model versioning (v1, v2, v3…)
- Data normalization (Min-Max scaling)
- Safe prediction range validation
- Logging system (app.log)
- Prediction history tracking
- Config-driven design
- Clean CLI UX

## 🧠 What This Project Demonstrates
- How ML models learn from data (not rules)
- Why normalization matters
- Handling real-world ML edge cases
- Writing maintainable, scalable Python code
- Daily GitHub progress & discipline
